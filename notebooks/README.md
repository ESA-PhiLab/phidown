# Phidown Jupyter Notebooks

This directory contains example notebooks demonstrating various capabilities of the phidown library for accessing Copernicus Earth Observation data and AIS maritime data.

## Available Notebooks

### 1. Search and Download (`1_search_n_download.ipynb`)
**Basic data discovery and download workflow**
- Search SENTINEL-1 data with customizable filters
- Filter by processing level, operational mode, and other attributes
- Download selected products to local directory
- Ideal for: Getting started with phidown, understanding search parameters

### 2. Interactive Polygon Tool (`2_interactive_polygon_tool.ipynb`)
**Interactive area selection for data queries**
- Use interactive maps to draw areas of interest
- Generate WKT polygons for spatial filtering
- Visualize search areas before querying data
- Ideal for: Interactive data exploration, visual area selection

### 3. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Intersection (`3_interesect_S2_S1.ipynb`)
**Multi-sensor data analysis**
- Find overlapping Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (optical) data
- Temporal and spatial correlation analysis
- Compare different sensor modalities for the same area
- Ideal for: Multi-sensor studies, data fusion applications

### 4. Quick SAR + AIS Example (`4_sar_and_ais_integration.ipynb`)
**Comprehensive maritime monitoring analysis**
- Search for Sentinel-1 SAR imagery over shipping areas
- Download corresponding AIS vessel tracking data
- Spatial and temporal correlation of satellite and vessel data
- Vessel activity analysis and visualization
- Export integrated datasets for further analysis
- Ideal for: Maritime surveillance, vessel detection validation, shipping route analysis


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Basic phidown installation
pip install phidown

# For interactive tools (notebooks 2, 4)
pip install phidown[viz]

# For AIS functionality (notebooks 4, 5)
pip install phidown[ais]

# For full functionality
pip install phidown[viz,ais]
```

### Running the Notebooks
1. Start Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory
3. Open any notebook file (`.ipynb`)
4. Run cells sequentially or as needed

### Authentication
Some notebooks require authentication for downloading data:
- Set up Copernicus Data Space credentials
- Configure authentication as described in the main documentation

## Use Cases by Domain

### Earth Observation Research
- **Notebooks 1, 2, 3**: Basic data access, multi-sensor analysis
- Focus on land monitoring, change detection, environmental studies

### Maritime Applications
- **Notebooks 4, 5**: SAR imagery + AIS vessel tracking
- Focus on maritime surveillance, shipping analysis, vessel detection

### Interactive Analysis
- **Notebook 2**: Interactive map-based area selection
- **Notebook 4**: Comprehensive visualization and analysis

### Educational/Training
- **Notebooks 1, 5**: Simple, focused examples
- **Notebooks 2, 3, 4**: Advanced concepts and workflows

## Data Sources

### Satellite Data (Copernicus)
- **Sentinel-1**: SAR (radar) imagery, weather-independent
- **Sentinel-2**: Optical imagery, high resolution
- **Sentinel-3**: Ocean and land monitoring
- **Landsat**: Complementary optical data

### AIS Data (Hugging Face)
- Global vessel tracking data
- Automatic Identification System messages
- Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) information
- Temporal and spatial filtering capabilities

## Output and Results

Most notebooks generate:
- **CSV files**: Search results, vessel data, analysis summaries
- **Visualizations**: Maps, plots, statistical analyses
- **Metadata**: Processing logs, error reports
- **Integrated datasets**: Combined satellite and AIS data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import errors**: Check dependency installation
2. **Authentication**: Verify Copernicus credentials
3. **Data availability**: Some dates/areas may have limited data
4. **Memory usage**: Large datasets may require chunked processing

### Getting Help
- Check the main phidown documentation
- Review error messages and logs generated by notebooks
- Verify date ranges and geographic coordinates
- Ensure required dependencies are installed

## Contributing

To add new notebooks:
1. Follow the existing naming convention (`N_descriptive_name.ipynb`)
2. Include clear markdown documentation
3. Add your notebook to this README
4. Test with different data scenarios
5. Include error handling and user guidance

## Next Steps

After running these notebooks, you can:
- Integrate phidown into your own analysis workflows
- Combine with other geospatial libraries (GDAL, rasterio, geopandas)
- Develop automated processing pipelines
- Create custom visualization and analysis tools
- Scale up to operational monitoring systems
