  # Acquisition mode:
  # - 'slc': Download full SLC products (typically 5-8 GB each)
  # - 'burst': Download individual bursts (typically 1-2 GB each)
  mode: slc
  
  # Polarisation channel: VV, VH, HH, or HV
  # VV is the most common for InSAR applications
  # Note: For SLC mode, products contain all available polarisations
  #       Polarisation filtering is only used in burst mode
  polarisation: VV
  
  # Orbit direction: ASCENDING, DESCENDING, or null for auto-detection
  # If null, the script will find the optimal orbit based on:
  # - Maximum AOI coverage
  # - Regional preference:
  #   - Descending preferred for Europe/America (longitude -180 to 60)
  #   - Ascending preferred for Asia/Australia (longitude 60 to 180)
  orbit_direction: null
  
  # Relative orbit number (track): 1-175, or null for auto-detection
  # Setting this ensures consistent imaging geometry for InSAR time series
  relative_orbit: 66
  
  # Platform filter: list of satellites to include
  # Options: 'A' (S1A), 'B' (S1B), 'C' (S1C), 'D' (S1D), or 'all'
  # Examples:
  #   - [all]: Include all available satellites
  #   - [A]: Only Sentinel-1A
  #   - [A, B]: Both Sentinel-1A and 1B
  #   - [C, D]: Both Sentinel-1C and 1D
  platforms:
    - all
  
  # ========== Burst-specific parameters (only used when mode=burst) ==========
  
  # Swath identifier: IW1, IW2, IW3 (null for auto-selection)
  # Priority order (lower incidence angle preferred):
  # - IW1 (highest priority, lowest incidence angle ~31°)
  # - IW2 (medium priority, medium incidence angle ~38°)
  # - IW3 (lowest priority, highest incidence angle ~45°)
  swath_identifier: null
  
  # Specific burst ID to search for (optional)
  # Use this for targeted InSAR time series on a specific burst
