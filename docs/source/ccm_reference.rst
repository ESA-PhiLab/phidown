CCM (Copernicus Contributing Missions) Reference Guide
=======================================================

This reference guide provides detailed information about Copernicus Contributing Missions (CCM) data access through the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem.

Overview
--------

The Copernicus Contributing Missions (CCM) are commercial and public satellites that complement the data from the Sentinel constellation. These missions provide additional Earth observation data that enhance the Copernicus Services with higher spatial resolution, alternative measurement techniques, and increased temporal coverage.

**Key Features:**
- High-resolution optical and SAR imagery
- Complementary measurements to Sentinel missions
- Enhanced temporal and spatial coverage
- Access to commercial satellite data through Copernicus

Registration and Access
-----------------------

To access CCM data, you need to register separately from the standard Copernicus Data Space account.

**How to Register for CCM Access:**

1. Visit the CCM registration page: https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/copernicus-contributing-missions/ccm-how-to-register

2. Follow the registration process which includes:
   - Creating a Copernicus Data Space account (if you don't have one)
   - Requesting access to specific CCM collections
   - Accepting terms and conditions for commercial data access
   - Waiting for approval (approval time varies by collection)

3. Once approved, you can access CCM data using your credentials through Φ-Down

**Important Notes:**
- CCM access is subject to specific terms and conditions
- Some CCM collections may have usage restrictions
- Access may be limited based on user category (research, commercial, etc.)
- Data availability varies by collection and region

Common Use Cases
----------------

**High-Resolution Optical Imagery:**
- Urban monitoring and change detection
- Agricultural assessment
- Infrastructure mapping
- Detailed land cover classification

**Complementary SAR Data:**
- Gap filling between Sentinel-1 acquisitions
- Enhanced temporal resolution for time-series analysis
- Alternative sensor perspectives

**Multi-Mission Integration:**
- Combining CCM data with Sentinel missions
- Enhanced spatial resolution for specific applications
- Cross-calibration and validation studies

Troubleshooting
---------------

**Access Denied Errors:**
- Verify that you have completed CCM registration
- Check that your access request has been approved
- Ensure your credentials are correctly configured

**No Results Found:**
- Verify that CCM data is available for your area and time period
- Check that you're using the correct product type
- Consider expanding your temporal or spatial search parameters

**Download Issues:**
- Ensure your S3 credentials are properly configured
- Verify that you have sufficient storage space
- Check your network connection
